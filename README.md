# SEI-Project-1
OMICRON - Lrr & Ndnd are coming to take over Earth!

## Elevator Pitch
A Space Invaders styled game in which one player battles aliens invaders and attempts to destroy them before they land and destroy the planet! The player will have barriers to hide behind and the ability to move left to right, as the aliens move back and forth and drop closer to the planet. Score will be kept, each alien hit providing points with more awarded for aliens higher up in the formation.

## MVP Goals
- Welcome screen with instructions + start button
- Clicking start button begins game
- Player can move left and right and shoot a projectile up from it's current position
- Four barriers for player protection
- Three rows of aliens that move left to right consistently and drop down at set intervals, increasing steadily
- Projectile 'kills' aliens when hit, removing it from the stack
- Front row of aliens shoots it's own projectiles down at player at random intervals
- Game ends when aliens touch barriers, hit the player with their projectile 3 times, or player shoots all aliens

## Stretch Goals
- Easy, Normal, Hard difficulties
- Barriers that break down with hits from both entities
- High score logging
- Images or sprites for player ship and aliens
- High-point-value aliens out of formation that appear randomly and cross the game screen once
